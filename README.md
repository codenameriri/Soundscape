Messing around with possible soundscapes for EEGJ. Assumes a properly arragned Ableton set.

This repo also has the MOST UP TO DATE version of RiriFramework!

You can control:    
* Focus/Relax Level (LEFT for Relax, RIGHT for Focus)    
* Temp (UP and DOWN to increase or decrease, respectively)    
* High Pass Filter ('q' to increase, 'a' to decrease)    
* Low Pass Filter ('w' to increase, 's' to decrease)
